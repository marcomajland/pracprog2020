1: The Main method is the initializing method from which all other classes/methods are called upon in the program.
2: Source code is the programming code written by the programmer, i.e. Python or C# code. The bytecode is an intermediate code which is
translated from the source code by a compiler. A software interpreter then interprets the bytecode and converts it into executuble code which
may be run by the processor.
3: Use a compiler to compile the C# source code into bytecode, for example the Mono C# compiler. The CLR (Common Language Runtime) is a virtual
machine which executes the intermediate bytecode.
4: Use the command mono filename.cs. The runtime environment then uses the bytecode to execute the processor instructions.
5: Bytecode libraries are made using the mcs compiler and may be constructed using the linking feature of the make utility.
6: In the Makefile, it is possible to link the Main method with a library through the following make utility command:

main.exe : main.cs library.dll
	mcs -reference:library.dll main.cs
